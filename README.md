# Virtual Reality Course Project

This project is a VR driving simulator with some racing to the checkpoints in limited time mechanics. This project uses Unity Engine with Google Cardboard SDK for VR.
This has a low poly artstyle with a popping audio, and uses taps to interat with the environment. Keeping the screen tapped makes the car go forward. The project uses Cardboard SDK to track the orientation of the head and uses it to rotate the camera and uses the SDK to get the camera render two images slightly shifted from one another to give the parallax effect seen in VR tech.
